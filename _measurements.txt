-we are searching for legacy measurement files

 -most thickness measurements in database are from GCI study

 -"gloss" and "Gloss?" columns in database do not match
 
 -may be that "Gloss?" checkboxes for some gloss-measured papers were left unchecked

 -"gloss.xlsx" raw file contains 1550 unique catalog numbers, and there are 1551 non-null values in "Gloss?" column, but union set is much larger than intersection

 -"gloss.xlsx" also contains many catalog numbers that do not exist in database
 
 -need to be checked for 'primary' catalog number neighbors (idea is that secondary numbers are wrong)

-not all measurements use the [catalog]_[manbran] format
 -some omit the manbran
 -some have it, but have the order backwards

-sometimes entire catalog numbers, including the manbran suffix, occur in more than one binder (referring to texture images here). That's either impossible, or a weird fact about the binders we need to address.


TEXTURE
-texture images, and their pre-processed counterparts, live on the server share, put there by Jack

-I've converted many to JPG for display purposes, using native Mac tools for conversion
 
 ``$ open *.tif -a ~/Desktop/TIFF2JPG.app``

 -sometimes this needs to be run a few times in a folder, because a large queue of files will sometimes choke it

-tiles were created by sp.py (in Yente utils), using Nick's scripts

-for texture files, there are a number of things to check:
 -NN
  -by slice pairs
  -by trial
  -by catalog (average across all tiles)
  -by representative
   -trial as rep
   -tile as rep *(this is what yente does)
 -medians to reduce outliers?
 -synthesize images from averaged parameters? (probably not)
 -Yente app
  -chooses a vector rep by finding the tile closest to the centroid for all tiles in a pocket
  -chooses an 'image' rep by selecting the image with the highest tile centrality
