<After removing any 'processed' or 'cropped' folders from the tree 'LML Collection',
I ran this script with the default preprocess settings. This is every texture image we have 
right now. I had just run some tests showing that these preprocess parameters are very
robust and the results between then are very linearly correlated (~0.99). Have not yet tested
whether subtraction vs. division is the cause of the significant nonlinearity I observed
after running this script on the total data, with parameters {1024,250,151,5,divide} and
then {1365,250,201,5,subtract}. By 'total data', I'm here including even the processed
and cropped images that were later removed. The results between these two parameter settings
were rank-correlated pretty strongly (~0.75), but essentially uncorrelated linearly (0.4).>
